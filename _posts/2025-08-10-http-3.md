# EHLO from HTTP/3.0

Yes, I know **EHLO** is an SMTP command, not HTTP - but I couldn’t resist borrowing it as a geeky “hello.”  
Think of it as my way of introducing a protocol with another protocol’s greeting.  

Now that we’ve broken the ice - HTTP/3 is here, and while it still speaks “HTTP,” it drives on a completely different highway.  
For backend developers, this is the first time in decades that the transport layer underneath HTTP is changing - and it’s a big deal for both **performance** and **security**.  
And don’t worry, if you’re not a backend developer, I promise to keep it human-friendly ;)


## From HTTP/1.1 → HTTP/2 → HTTP/3

Before we jump into QUIC, let’s quickly rewind.

**HTTP/1.1 (1997)**  
- One request per TCP connection  
- Browsers opened multiple connections to speed things up  
- Head-of-line blocking was a nightmare (one slow resource could block others)

**HTTP/2 (2015)**  
- Multiplexing: multiple streams over a single TCP connection  
- Header compression (HPACK)  
- Server push  
- BUT… still TCP, still suffers from TCP-level head-of-line blocking.

**Why that’s a problem:** TCP delivers packets in order. If one packet is lost, everything behind it waits, even if it’s unrelated.

## Why HTTP/3 Exists

Mobile users switch networks all the time. One moment they’re on Wi-Fi, the next they’re on 5G - and TCP hates that.  
Every network change = connection drop = new handshake.

HTTP/3 fixes this by ditching TCP entirely and running on **QUIC** (Quick UDP Internet Connection), a modern transport protocol built on **UDP**, designed to improve the speed and reliability of web connections.

## QUIC in a Nutshell

If TCP is like a polite postal service (guaranteed delivery, in order, with signatures), QUIC is like a private courier with GPS tracking, encryption, and a motorcycle.

**Key QUIC benefits:**
- **Runs over UDP** → avoids TCP’s head-of-line blocking
- **TLS 1.3 built-in** → always encrypted, faster handshake
- **Connection migration** → keeps working when your IP changes
- **0-RTT handshakes** → faster page loads, especially after reconnects
- **Better congestion control** for flaky networks

⚠️ **Note:** QUIC doesn’t make lost data magically appear.  
If a missing packet belongs to a specific stream, that stream must still wait for it before it can continue (e.g., you can’t render half an HTML file).  
The benefit is that **other streams keep flowing** instead of getting stuck behind the delay - something TCP can’t do because all streams share the same ordered delivery queue.

## How HTTP/3 Stacks Up

```plaintext
HTTP/1.1  -->  TCP  -->  TLS (optional)  --> Internet
HTTP/2    -->  TCP  -->  TLS (usually)   --> Internet
HTTP/3    -->  QUIC -->  UDP + TLS 1.3   --> Internet
````

## Backend Developer View

**Your application logic?** Probably won’t change.
**Your infrastructure?** That’s where you’ll notice the difference.

* **Server/CDN support:** nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Fastly already support HTTP/3
* **Reverse proxy configs:** may need new ports, certs, and UDP forwarding
* **Debugging:** trickier, since QUIC encrypts transport layer
* **Fallback:** clients that don’t speak HTTP/3 will use HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1

## Security Gains

With HTTP/3, **TLS 1.3 is non-optional** - no “accidentally unencrypted” requests.
Shorter handshakes = less time for attackers to interfere.
Stronger forward secrecy and faster recovery after connection drops.

## Performance Gains

* **Lower latency** on initial connections
* **Smooth performance on flaky mobile networks**
* **Multiplexed streams without TCP-level blocking**
* Faster repeated connections with **0-RTT**

## Example: FastAPI with HTTP/3

You can run a FastAPI app with HTTP/3 using `hypercorn`:

```bash
pip install hypercorn[http3] fastapi
```

**`app.py`**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello HTTP/3"}
```

Run with:

```bash
hypercorn app:app \
  --bind localhost:443 \
  --certfile cert.pem \
  --keyfile key.pem \
  --quic-bind localhost:4433
```

Visit with a browser that supports HTTP/3 (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and check in dev tools → Network → Protocol.

## Who’s Already Using HTTP/3

* Google Search & YouTube
* Facebook & Instagram
* Cloudflare-powered sites
* Most major CDNs

## Final Thoughts

HTTP/3 isn’t just “HTTP/2 but faster.”
It’s a new transport layer designed for **a mobile-first, encryption-by-default web**.
Whether you’re a backend developer, a network engineer, or just someone tired of loading spinners - HTTP/3 is worth paying attention to.

Because in the new web, speed and security are not optional - they’re the starting point.
