Hi, I’m Or Ezra — but you can call me **orez-rj**.

I’m a backend developer at Fortinet with a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the Open University of Israel. Over the past few years, I’ve grown increasingly obsessed with the foundations of cyberspace - things like **encryption**, **authentication**, and **real-time systems**.

This blog is my place to explore how things work under the hood. Whether it’s the inner workings of TLS, building zero-trust auth flows, or writing fast and safe CLI tools in Rust, I use this space to learn out loud and share my findings.

### 🔍 What you’ll find here:
- Deep dives into cybersecurity, cryptography, and backend architecture  
- Explorations of tools and protocols (Django, FastAPI, Kubernetes, AWS, and more)  
- Thoughts, mini-projects, and breakdowns of interesting systems

Whether you're a fellow backend dev, a security-curious tinkerer, or just someone who enjoys peeling back abstraction layers - I hope you’ll find something valuable here.

Thanks for stopping by 👋
